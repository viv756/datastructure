when to use BFS

when you think the answer is near root use BFS. 
when you ar asked to search by level



when to use DFS

when you need to do something at that level and then go down use pre order
when you need the leftmost value use inorder
if you want to perform some functions at the last use post order

 Preorder (Node → Left → Right)
 → If the work is done before recursive calls, it’s preorder.

 Inorder (Left → Node → Right)
 → If the work is done between left and right recursive calls, it’s inorder.

 Postorder (Left → Right → Node)
 → If the work is done after both recursive calls, it’s postorder.
